<p>Hello, my name is Tony Waters. I've been programming since I was 14, and apart from a 5-year break in 2008, I have been either programming or teaching programming. I'm 48 now, so that's a lot of typing!</p>

<p>My main language is Java, which I delivered developer-training on until about 2004. I also delivered courses on PHP and JavaScript, as well as more genereal E-Commerce. I loved training. But ironically, training computer languages took up all of my time and I missed actually using them. So from 2004 onwards I did less training and more programming.</p>

<p>I spent 3 years working for large corporates, on substantial systems. Following a 5-year sabatical, I returned to development in 2013. </p>

<p>My skills: Java, Spring, Angular, db experience.
