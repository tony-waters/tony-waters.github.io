<p>Hello, my name is Tony Waters. I am a JEE Developer with strong core Java, Spring and Design Patterns. I am a Sun Certified Java Programmer, and Sun Certified Web Component Developer. I am also a CIW Certified Instructor and CIW Certified Enterprise Developer.</p>

<p>I have server-side and client-side skills, including a good understanding of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. As such I don't mind if my Objects are <i>java.lang</i> or <i>JSON</i> based. I also really like using AngularJS.</p>

<p>I have worked with big database systems like Oracle, and run my tests in RAM on tiny ones like H2. I like to develop in Java, so prefer JPA to SQL. But I'm good to sit round a table with a DBA and discuss the transition.</p>

<p>Following best practices is important to me, and I prefer to stick to standards where practicable. I have used TDD for some time, and the related Java technologies (JUnit, DbUnit, Mockito, Hamcrest, Fest/AssertJ), and recently introduced BDD into my practices (Jasmine, Cucumber). I have worked in teams where the ethos has been agile-oriented, following continuous integration and working iteratively and incrementally with the Product Owner.

<p>The posts here and related sources on <a href="https://github.com/tony-waters/">GitHub</a> should give you some idea of the level of my coding.</p>
    
<p>I work freelance, so drop me a line if I'm what you're looking for, or if you have any comments on the site content.</p>
