<p>Hello, my name is Tony Waters. I am a JEE Developer with strong core Java, Spring and Design Patterns. 5 years Java/Spring development, and the same as a Java/JEE Trainer. I am a Sun Certified Java Programmer, and Web Component Developer.</p>

<p>I have server-side and client-side skills, including a good understanding of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. As such I don't mind if my Objects are java.lang or JSON based. I also really like using AngularJS.</p>

<p>I have worked with big database systems like Oracle, and run my tests in RAM on tiny ones like H2. I like to develop in Java, so prefer JPA to SQL. But I'm good to sit round a table with a DBA and discuss the transition.</p>

<p>Following best practices is important to me, and I prefer to stick to standards where practicable. I have used TDD for some time, and the related Java technologies (JUint, DbUnit, Mockito, Hamcrest, Fest/AssertJ), and recently introduced BDD into my practices. I have worked in teams where the ethos has been agile-oriented, following continuous integration and working iteratively and incrementally with the Product Owner.

<p>The posts here and related sources on [GitHub](https://github.com/tony-waters/) should give you some example of the level of my coding.</p>
    
<p>I'm looking for my next contacting position, so drop me a line if I'm what you're looking for, or if you have any comments on the site content.</p>
