<p>Hello, my name is Tony Waters. I am a full-stack JEE Developer with strong core Java, Spring and Design Patterns. 5 years Java/Spring development, 6 years as a Java/JEE Trainer. I am a Sun Certified Java Programmer, and Web Component Developer.</p>

<p>I have server-side and client-side skills. I consider myself a Java/JEE developer with good knowledge of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. As such I don't mind if my Objects are java.lang or JSON based. I also really like using AngularJS.</p>

<p>I have worked with big database systems like Oracle, and run my tests in RAM on tiny ones like H2. I like to develop in Java so want to abstract the data source as soon as practicably possible. So I prefer JPA to SQL. But I'm good to sit round a table with a DBA and discuss the transition.</p>

<p>Following best practices is important to me, and I prefer to stick to standards where practicable. I have used TDD for some time, and the related Java technologies (DbUnit, Mockito, JUnit, . I have not used BDD in a project but have learned Cucumber and ??? and used it enough to desire to use it in my next one.</p>

<p>I'm looking for my next contacting position, so drop me a line if I'm what you're looking for, or if you have any comments on the site content.</p>
