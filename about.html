<p>Hello, my name is Tony Waters. I am a DevOps specialising in Docker.</p>

<p>I also have strong core Java, Spring and Design Patterns. I am a Sun Certified Java Programmer, and Sun Certified Web Component Developer. I am also a CIW Certified Instructor and CIW Certified Enterprise Developer.</p>

<p>On the DevOps side, I mainly use Ansible, Packer, TerraForm, and Kubernetes/OpenShift. I can set up servers manually from scratch, but prefer to use Packer. I mostly work in the cloud these days, mainly AWS and vCloud</p></p>

<p>I spend most of my time in an IDE or on the command-line.</p>

<p>I have server-side and client-side skills, including a good understanding of JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and AngularJS.</p>

<p>I have worked with big database systems like Oracle, and run my tests in RAM on tiny ones like H2. I am also familiar with ORM technologies and happy using JPA and SQL</p>

<p>The posts here and related sources on <a href="https://github.com/tony-waters/">GitHub</a> and <a href="https://hub.docker.com/u/bit1/">Docker Hub</a> should give you an idea of the level of my coding.</p>

<p>I work freelance, so drop me a line if I'm what you're looking for, or if you have any comments on the site content.</p>
