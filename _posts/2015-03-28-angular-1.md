AngularJs is a powerful and flexible framework, but badly documented in some places. Directives are the [killer] feature, but writing them can be very confusing, and there is also not much on best practices or general high-level design patterns, so even getting to writing them as a fundamental development activity is not [encouraged].

It is also moving at a fast pace. Some of the features discussed here was introduced in version 1.2 (first released Nov 2013) or 1.3 (Oct 2014) -- so things are moving at pace in the Angular world. Also, new features in 1.4 are set to slightly change how we do things. And Angular 2 is on the horizon, and its promise of Web Components.

In a series of posts, I'd like to look at what we can do right now, with Angular 1.3, to create re-usable components, and extend HTML to the needs of our application. Effectibvely making HTML into a Domain Specific Language.

###The extended HTML

###The components
